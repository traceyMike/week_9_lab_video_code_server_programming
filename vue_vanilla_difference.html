<!--  Difference between Vue and Vanilla Javascript
  
Vue:
Vue is a reactive framework, meanwhile Javascript manually selects and
updates elements. Vue automatically updates when data is changed, and 
when you bind the data in Vue, it updates the view of the program
when data is modified automatically. Student Roster with Vue has both
v-model, v-on, v-bind, which all help the data update automatically.
I think this makes the program ultimately work better and more smoothly.
I do not think it takes any more work than vanilla Javascript,
one just needs to be mindful of where you place handling for click events
and so on.

Vanilla Javascript:
When using vanilla JavaScript elemetns need to be manually selected
and updated with new data when a change occurs. To target elements, 
you need to use query selectors. So when writing the code you need
to mindful of where you are placing code. 

Which one do I prefer:
I think they both have pros and cons. We have been working with 
vanilla JavaScript longer than Vue, so I think I am aclimated to 
Vanilla JavaScript more, but I think Vue has its benefits and I'd
like to get better at that.
